# pythonhmm - Hidden Markov Model Library for Python

## Features

Implementation of all major algorithms related to Hidden Markov Models

- Viterbi Algorithm: calculating maximum probability state sequences
- Forward-backward algorithm: calculating joint and conditional probabilities for segments in sequences
- Supervised learning: training a model based on labelled data
- Unsupervised learning (Baum-Welch algorithm): train a model on unlabelled data using a special case of the EM algorithm.
